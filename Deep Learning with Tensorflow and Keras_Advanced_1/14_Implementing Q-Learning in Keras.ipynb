    "1. Modify the reward function to provide more granular feedback to the agent. For example, give higher rewards for keeping the pole more vertical and closer to the center. \n",
    "2. Implement a reward function that rewards the agent proportionally to the angle of the pole and the distance of the cart from the center. \n",
    "3. Train the agent with the new reward function and compare the learning speed and stability to the original setting.\n"
